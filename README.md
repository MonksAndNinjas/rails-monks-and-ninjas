# README

#Monks and Ninjas Rails Project

##Overview

The Monks and Ninjas Life Manager App allows users to efficiently structure and promote meaning in ones life. Once the app is setup the user will have access to recording family members, online subscriptions, short-term and long-term goals, weekly priorities, inspirations, and controlling bad habits.

##Installation

Once forked from github you will be required to run 'rake db:migrate and rake db:seed'.
db:seed will add the short quests and long quests.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Make sure to read notes in all files and primary code for views will be in layout and primary controller code will be in concerns and application_controller. These will be good places to start.
